# GeoMesa Statistics GeoServer 2.8.x Plugin

### Installation Instructions

After building, extract `target/geomesa-stats-gs-plugin-<version>-install.tar.gz` into GeoServer's
WEB-INF/lib directory.

### Additional Jars

By itself, this module will not provide the intended functionality.  You will need a catalog
listener bean that is not provided here.  Consequently, this module should be considered
experimental.
