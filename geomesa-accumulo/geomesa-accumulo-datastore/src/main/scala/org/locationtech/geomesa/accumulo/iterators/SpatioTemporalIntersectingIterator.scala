/**
 * This iterator returns as its nextKey and nextValue responses the key and value
 * from the DATA iterator, not from the INDEX iterator.  The assumption is that
 * the data rows are what we care about; that we do not care about the index
 * rows that merely helped us find the data rows quickly.
 *
 * The other trick to remember about iterators is that they essentially pre-fetch
 * data.  "hasNext" really means, "was there a next record that you already found".
