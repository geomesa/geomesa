# GeoMesa Jobs

### Building Instructions

This project contains map/reduce and scalding jobs for maintaining GeoMesa.

If you wish to build this project separately, you can with maven:

```shell
geomesa> mvn clean install -pl geomesa-jobs
```

### GeoMesa Input and Output Formats

GeoMesa provides input and output formats that can be used in Hadoop map/reduce jobs. The input/output formats
can be used directly in Scala, or there are Java interfaces under the ```interop``` package.

The input/output formats have two versions each, for compatibility with the 'old' Hadoop api (under the
```mapred``` package) and the 'new' Hadoop api (under the ```mapreduce``` package).

There are sample jobs provided that can be used as templates for more complex operations. These are:

```
org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.interop.mapred.FeatureCountJob
org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.interop.mapred.FeatureWriterJob
org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.interop.mapreduce.FeatureCountJob
org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.interop.mapreduce.FeatureWriterJob
```

#### GeoMesaInputFormat

The ```GeoMesaInputFormat``` can be used to get ```SimpleFeature```s into your jobs directly from GeoMesa.

Use the static ```configure``` method to set up your job. You need to provide it with a map of connection
parameters, which will be used to retrieve the GeoTools DataStore. You also need to provide a feature type
name. Optionally, you can provide a CQL filter, which will be used to select a subset of features in your
store.

The key provided to your mapper with be a ```Text``` with the ```SimpleFeature``` ID. The value will be
the ```SimpleFeature```.

#### GeoMesaOutputFormat

The ```GeoMesaOutputFormat``` can be used to write ```SimpleFeature```s back into GeoMesa.

Use the static ```configure``` method to set up your job. You need to provide it with a map of connection
parameters, which will be used to retrieve the GeoTools ```DataStore```. Optionally, you can also configure
the BatchWriter configuration used to write data to Accumulo.

The key you output does not matter, and will be ignored. The value should be a ```SimpleFeature``` that you
wish to write. If the ```SimpleFeatureType``` associated with the ```SimpleFeature``` does not yet exist in
GeoMesa, it will be created for you. You may write different ```SimpleFeatureType```s, but note that they
will all share a common catalog table.

### Maintenance Jobs

To facilitate running jobs, you may wish to build a shaded jar that contains all the required dependencies.
Ensure that the pom references the correct versions of hadoop, accumulo etc for your cluster, then build the
project using the 'assemble' profile

```shell
geomesa> mvn clean install -P assemble -pl geomesa-jobs
```

The following instructions assume you have built a shaded jar; if not you will need to use the 'libjars'
argument to ensure the correct jars are available on the distributed classpath.

#### Attribute Indexing

GeoMesa provides indexing on attributes to improve certain queries. You can indicate attributes that should
be indexed when you create your schema (simple feature type). If you decide later on that you would like to
index additional attributes, you can use the attribute indexing job. You only need to run this job once.

The job can be invoked through yarn as follows (jar version may vary slightly):

```shell
geomesa> yarn jar geomesa-jobs/target/geomesa-jobs-accumulo1.5-1.0.0.jar \
    com.twitter.scalding.Tool \
    org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.index.AttributeIndexJob \
    --hdfs \
    --geomesa.input.instanceId <instance> \
    --geomesa.input.zookeepers <zookeepers> \
    --geomesa.input.user <user> \
    --geomesa.input.password <pwd> \
    --geomesa.input.tableName <catalog-table> \
    --geomesa.input.feature <feature> \
    --geomesa.index.coverage <full|join> \ # optional attribute
    --geomesa.index.attributes <attributes to index - space separated>
```

(Note that if you did not build with the 'assemble' profile, you will also need to include an extensive
-libjars argument with all dependent jars)

#### Transitioning Indices

Between rc4 and rc5, incompatible schema changes were made. If you have data in the old format, but would like
to update to the new version, you may use the SortedIndexUpdateJob.

The job can be invoked through yarn as follows (jar version may vary slightly):

```shell
yarn jar geomesa-jobs/target/geomesa-jobs-accumulo1.5-1.0.0.jar \
    com.twitter.scalding.Tool \
    org.locationtech.geomesa.jobs.index.SortedIndexUpdateJob \
    --hdfs \
    --geomesa.input.instanceId <instance> \
    --geomesa.input.zookeepers <zookeepers> \
    --geomesa.input.user <user> \
    --geomesa.input.password <pwd> \
    --geomesa.input.tableName <catalog-table> \
    --geomesa.input.feature <feature>
```

(Note that if you did not build with the 'assemble' profile, you will also need to include an extensive
-libjars argument with all dependent jars)
