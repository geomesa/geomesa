A configurable and extensible library for converting data into SimpleFeatures

## Overview

Converters for various different data formats (currently supported: delimited text, Avro, fixed width) can be configured and instantiated using the ```SimpleFeatureConverters``` factory and a target ```SimpleFeatureType```.  The converter allows the specification of fields extracted from the data and transformations on those fields.  Syntax of transformations is very much like ```awk``` syntax.  Fields with names that correspond to attribute names in the ```SimpleFeatureType``` will be directly populated in the result SimpleFeature.  Fields that do not align with attributes in the ```SimpleFeatureType``` are assumed to be intermediate fields used for deriving attributes.  Fields can reference other fields by name for building up complex attributes.

## Example usage

Suppose you have a ```SimpleFeatureType``` with the following schema: ```phrase:String,dtg:Date,geom:Point:srid=4326``` and comma-separated data as shown below.

    first,hello,2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,45.0,45.0
    second,world,2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,45.0,45.0                                                                                                                                                                    
The first two fields should be concatenated together to form the phrase, the third field should be parsed as a date, and the last two fields should be formed into a ```Point``` geometry.  The following configuration file defines an appropriate converter for taking this csv data and transforming it into our ```SimpleFeatureType```.  

     converter = { 
      type         = "delimited-text",
      format       = "DEFAULT",
      id-field     = "md5($0)",
      fields = [
        { name = "phrase", transform = "concat($1, $2)" },
        { name = "lat",    transform = "$4::double" },
        { name = "lon",    transform = "$5::double" },
        { name = "dtg",    transform = "dateHourMinuteSecondMillis($3)" },
        { name = "geom",   transform = "point($lat, $lon)" }
      ]
     }

The ```id``` of the ```SimpleFeature``` is formed from an md5 hash of the entire record (```$0``` is the original data) and the other fields are formed from appropriate transforms.

## Transformation functions

Currently supported transformation functions are listed below.

### String functions
 * ```stripQuotes```
 * ```trim```
 * ```capitalize```
 * ```lowercase```
 * ```regexReplace```
 * ```concat```
 * ```substr```
 * ```strlen```

### Date functions
 * ```now```
 * ```date```
 * ```isodate```
 * ```isodatetime```
 * ```dateHourMinuteSecondMillis```

 
### Geometry functions
 * ```point```

### Avro Path functions
 * ```avroPath```

## Extending the converter library

There are two ways to extend the converter library - adding new transformation functions and adding new data formats.

### Adding new transformation functions

To add new transformation functions, create a ```TransformationFunctionFactory``` and register it in ```META-INF/services/org.locationtech.geomesa.convert.TransformationFunctionFactory```.  For example, here's how to add a new transformation function that computes a SHA-256 hash.

```scala
class SHAFunctionFactory extends TransformerFunctionFactory {
  override def functions = Seq(sha256)
  val sha256fn = TransformerFn("sha256") { args => Hashing.sha256().hashBytes(args(0).asInstanceOf[Array[Byte]]) }
}
```

The ```sha256``` function can then be used in a field as shown.

```
   ...
   fields: [
      { name = "hash", transform = "sha256($0)" }
   ]
```

### Adding new data formats

To add new data formats, implement the ```SimpleFeatureConverterFactory``` and ```SimpleFeatureConverter``` interfaces and register them in ```META-INF/services``` appropriately.  See ```org.locationtech.geomesa.convert.avro.Avro2SimpleFeatureConverter``` for an example.
