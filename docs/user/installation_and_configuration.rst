Installation and Configuration
==============================

This chapter describes how to install and configure GeoMesa on a Linux system.
This includes installation of the Accumulo and Kafka data stores and
installation and configuration of the GeoServer plugins.

Prerequisites and Platform
--------------------------

.. warning::

    GeoMesa requires `Accumulo <http://accumulo.apache.org/>`_ |accumulo_version|, which in turn
    requires `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org/>`_ |hadoop_version| and `ZooKeeper <http://zookeeper.apache.org>`_
    |zookeeper_version|. Installing and configuring Accumulo is beyond the scope of this manual.

    Using the `Kafka <http://kafka.apache.org/>`_ module requires Kafka |kafka_version| and ZooKeeper |zookeeper_version|.  

To install the binary distribution:

* `Java JRE or JDK 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__,

To build and install the source distribution:

* `Java JDK 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__,
* Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) |maven_version|
* A ``git`` client (http://git-scm.com/)

GeoMesa artifacts can be downloaded from the LocationTech Maven repository: https://repo.locationtech.org/content/repositories/geomesa-releases/.

Snapshot artifacts are available in the LocationTech snapshots repository: https://repo.locationtech.org/content/repositories/geomesa-snapshots/.

.. _install_binary:

Installing from the Binary Distribution
---------------------------------------

GeoMesa artifacts are available for download or can be built from source. 
The easiest way to get started is to download the most recent binary version (``$VERSION`` = |release|) 
and untar it somewhere convenient. For example, to download and prepare the geomesa-accumulo binary:

.. code-block:: bash

    # download and unpackage the most recent distribution
    $ wget http://repo.locationtech.org/content/repositories/geomesa-releases/org/locationtech/geomesa/geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11/$VERSION/geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION
    $ ls
    bin/  conf/  dist/  docs/  emr4/  examples/  lib/  LICENSE.txt  logs/

Building from Source
--------------------

GeoMesa may also be built from source. For more information refer to :ref:`building_from_source`
in the :doc:`/developer/index`, or to the ``README.md`` file in the the
source distribution. The remainder of the instructions in this chapter assume
the use of the binary GeoMesa distribution. If you have built from source, the
distribution is created in the ``/target`` directory of each respective module as a part of
the build process.

More information about developing with GeoMesa may be found in the :doc:`/developer/index`.

.. _install_accumulo_runtime:

Installing the Accumulo Distributed Runtime Library
---------------------------------------------------

The ``geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION/dist/accumulo/`` directory contains the distributed
runtime JARs that contains server-side code for Accumulo that must be made
available on each of the Accumulo tablet servers in the cluster. These JARs
contain GeoMesa code and the Accumulo iterator required for querying
GeoMesa data.

.. warning::

    There are two runtime JARs available, with and without raster support. Only one is
    needed and including both will cause classpath issues.

The version of the distributed runtime JAR must match the version of the GeoMesa
data store client JAR (usually installed in GeoServer; see below). If not,
queries might not work correctly or at all.

Manual Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The desired runtime JAR should be copied into the ``$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext`` folder on
each tablet server.

.. code-block:: bash

    # something like this for each tablet server
    $ scp geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION/dist/accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-distributed-runtime_2.11-$VERSION.jar tserver1:$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext
    # or for raster support
    $ scp geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION/dist/accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-distributed-runtime-raster_2.11-$VERSION.jar tserver1:$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext

.. note::

    You do not need the JAR on the Accumulo master server, and including
    it there may cause classpath issues later.

.. _install_accumulo_runtime_namespace:

Namespace Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Copying the runtime JAR to each tablet server as above will work, but in
Accumulo 1.6+, we can leverage namespaces to isolate the GeoMesa classpath
from the rest of Accumulo.

To install the distributed runtime JAR, use the ``setup-namespace.sh``
script in the ``geomesa-accumulo-dist_2.11-$VERSION/dist/accumulo`` directory.

.. code::

    $ ./setup-namespace.sh -u myUser -n myNamespace

The command line arguments the script accepts are:

* -u <Accumulo username>
* -n <Accumulo namespace>
* -p <Accumulo password> (optional, will prompt if not supplied)
* -g <Path of GeoMesa distributed runtime JAR> (optional, will default to the distribution folder and without raster support)
* -h <HDFS URI e.g. hdfs://localhost:54310> (optional, will attempt to determine if not supplied)

Alternatively you can manually install the distributed runtime JAR with these commands:

.. code::

    $ accumulo shell -u root
    > createnamespace myNamespace
    > grant NameSpace.CREATE_TABLE -ns myNamespace -u myUser
    > config -s general.vfs.context.classpath.myNamespace=hdfs://NAME_NODE_FDQN:54310/accumulo/classpath/myNamespace/[^.].*.jar
    > config -ns myNamespace -s table.classpath.context=myNamespace

Then copy the distributed runtime JAR into HDFS under the path you specified.
The path above is just an example; you can included nested folders with project
names, version numbers, and other information in order to have different versions of GeoMesa on
the same Accumulo instance. You should remove any GeoMesa JARs under
``$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext`` to prevent any classpath conflicts.

.. note::

    When connecting to a data store using Accumulo namespaces, you must prefix
    the ``tableName`` parameter with the namespace. For example, refer to the
    ``my_catalog`` table as ``myNamespace.my_catalog``.

.. _setting_up_commandline:

Setting up the Command Line Tools
---------------------------------

.. note::

    The command line tools currently support the Accumulo and Kafka
    data stores.

Accumulo Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    To use the Accumulo data store with the command line tools, you need to install
    the distributed runtime first. See :ref:`install_accumulo_runtime`.

GeoMesa comes with a set of command line tools for managing accumulo features located in ``geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/bin/`` of the binary distribution or ``geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-dist/target/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/bin/`` of the source distribution.

.. note::

    You can configure environment variables and classpath settings in geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/bin/geomesa-env.sh.

In the ``geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION`` directory, run ``bin/geomesa configure`` to set up the tools.

.. code-block:: bash

    ### in geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/:
    $ bin/geomesa configure
    Warning: GEOMESA_HOME is not set, using /path/to/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION
    Using GEOMESA_HOME as set: /path/to/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION
    Is this intentional? Y\n y
    Warning: GEOMESA_LIB already set, probably by a prior configuration.
    Current value is /path/to/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/lib.

    Is this intentional? Y\n y

    To persist the configuration please update your bashrc file to include: 
    export GEOMESA_HOME=/path/to/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION
    export PATH=${GEOMESA_HOME}/bin:$PATH

Update and re-source your ``~/.bashrc`` file to include the ``$GEOMESA_HOME`` and ``$PATH`` updates.

.. warning::

    Please note that the ``$GEOMESA_HOME`` variable points to the location of the ``geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION``
    directory, not the main geomesa binary distribution directory!

.. note::

    ``geomesa`` will read the ``$ACCUMULO_HOME`` and ``$HADOOP_HOME`` environment variables to load the
    appropriate JAR files for Hadoop, Accumulo, Zookeeper, and Thrift. If possible, we recommend
    installing the tools on the Accumulo master server, as you may also need various configuration
    files from Hadoop/Accumulo in order to run certain commands. In addition ``geomesa`` will pull any
    additional jars from the ``$GEOMESA_EXTRA_CLASSPATHS`` environment variable into the class path.
    Use the ``geomesa classpath`` command in order to see what JARs are being used.

    If you are running the tools on a system without
    Accumulo installed and configured, the ``install-hadoop-accumulo.sh`` script
    in the ``bin`` directory may be used to download the needed Hadoop/Accumulo JARs into
    the ``lib/common`` directory. You should edit this script to match the versions used by your
    installation.

Due to licensing restrictions, dependencies for shape file support and raster
ingest must be separately installed. Do this with the following commands: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/install-jai.sh
    $ bin/install-jline.sh

Test the command that invokes the GeoMesa Tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ geomesa

.. note::

    See :ref:`slf4j_configuration` for information about configuring the SLF4J implementation.

Kafka Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    These instructions are identical for Kafka 0.8.x, 0.9.x, and 0.10.x. The value of ``$KAFKAVERSION`` is
    "08" for Kafka 0.8.x, "09" for Kafka 0.9.x, or "10" for Kafka 0.10.x.

GeoMesa comes with a set of command line tools for managing Kafka features. For each version of Kafka, a binary GeoMesa Kafka distribution is available (:ref:`versions_and_downloads`). In each distribution the Kafka tools are located in ``geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-dist_2.11-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz/bin/``. If building from source (:ref:`building_from_source`) the Kafka tools for each Kafka version are located in ``geomesa-kafka/geomesa-kafka-dist/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-dist/target/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz`` respectively.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd geomesa-$VERSION/geomesa-kafka/geomesa-kafka-dist/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-dist/target/
    $ tar -xzvf geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz
    $ cd geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION
    $ ls
    bin/  conf/  dist/  docs/  examples/  lib/  LICENSE.txt

The instructions below assume that the ``geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION`` directory is kept in the
``geomesa-kafka/geomesa-kafka-dist/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-dist/target/`` directory, but the tools distribution may be moved elsewhere
as desired.

.. note::

    You can configure environment variables and classpath settings in geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION/bin/geomesa-env.sh.

In the ``geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION`` directory, run ``bin/geomesa configure`` to set up the tools.

.. code-block:: bash

    ### in geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION:
    $ bin/geomesa-kafka configure
    Using GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME as set: /path/to/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION
    Is this intentional? Y\n y
    Warning: GEOMESA_LIB already set, probably by a prior configuration.
    Current value is /path/to/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION/lib.

    Is this intentional? Y\n y

    To persist the configuration please update your bashrc file to include:
    export GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME=/path/to/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION
    export PATH=${GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME}/bin:$PATH

Update and re-source your ``~/.bashrc`` file to include the ``$GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME`` and ``$PATH`` updates.

.. warning::

    Please note that the ``$GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME`` variable points to the location of the ``geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION``
    directory, not the main geomesa binary distribution directory!

.. note::

    ``geomesa-kafka`` will read the ``$GEOMESA_EXTRA_CLASSPATHS`` environment variable to load any
    additional jars into the classpath. Use the ``geomesa classpath`` command in order to see what
    JARs are being used.

Due to licensing restrictions, dependencies for shape file support and raster
ingest must be separately installed. Do this with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/install-jai.sh
    $ bin/install-jline.sh

Test the command that invokes the GeoMesa Tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ geomesa-kafka
    Using GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME = /path/to/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION
    Usage: geomesa-kafka [command] [command options]
      Commands:
        convert         Convert files using GeoMesa's internal SFT converter framework
        create-schema   Create a feature definition in GeoMesa
        get-schema      Describe the attributes of a given feature in GeoMesa
        get-names       List GeoMesa features for a given zkPath
        help            Show help
        listen          Listen to a GeoMesa Kafka topic
        remove-schema   Remove a schema and associated features from GeoMesa
        version         GeoMesa Version

.. _slf4j_configuration:

SLF4J Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoMesa Tools comes bundled by default with an SLF4J implementation that is installed to the ``$GEOMESA_HOME/lib``
or ``$GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME/lib`` directory named ``slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar``. If you already have an SLF4J implementation
installed on your Java classpath you may see errors at runtime and will have to exclude one of the JARs. This can be
done by simply renaming the bundled ``slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar`` file to ``slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar.exclude``.

Note that if no slf4j implementation is installed you will see this error:

.. code::

    SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
    SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
    SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.

In this case you may download SLF4J from http://www.slf4j.org/download.html. Extract
``slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar`` and place it in the ``lib/common`` directory of the binary distribution.
If this conflicts with another SLF4J implementation, you may need to remove it from the ``lib/common`` directory.


.. _install_geoserver_plugins:

Installing the GeoMesa GeoServer Plugins
----------------------------------------

.. warning::

    The GeoMesa GeoServer plugins require the use of GeoServer
    |geoserver_version| and GeoTools |geotools_version|.


As described in section :ref:`geomesa_and_geoserver`, GeoMesa implements a 
`GeoTools <http://geotools.org/>`_-compatible data store. This makes it possible
to use GeoMesa as a data store in `GeoServer <http://geoserver.org>`_. The documentation
below describes how to configure GeoServer to connect to GeoMesa Accumulo and Kafka data stores.
GeoServer's web site includes `installation instructions for GeoServer <http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/index.html>`_.

After GeoServer is running, you will also need to install the WPS plugin to
your GeoServer instance. The GeoServer WPS Plugin must match the version of
GeoServer instance. This is needed for both the Accumulo and Kafka variants of
the plugin. The GeoServer website includes `instructions for downloading and installing <http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wps/install.html>`_ the WPS plugin.

.. note::

    If using Tomcat as a web server, it will most likely be necessary to
    pass some custom options::

        export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx8g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -Duser.timezone=UTC -server -Djava.awt.headless=true"

    The value of ``-Xmx`` should be as large as your system will permit; this
    is especially important for the Kafka plugin. You
    should also consider passing ``-DGEOWEBCACHE_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/$USER-gwc``
    and ``-DEPSG-HSQL.directory=/tmp/$USER-hsql``
    as well. Be sure to restart Tomcat for changes to take place.

.. _install_accumulo_geoserver:

For Accumulo
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install GeoMesa's GeoServer plugin we can utilize the script ``manage-geoserver-plugins.sh`` in ``bin`` directory
of the GeoMesa Accumulo or GeoMesa Hadoop distributions. (``$VERSION`` = |release|)

.. note::

    If $GEOSERVER_HOME is set, then the ``--lib-dir`` parameter is not needed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/manage-geoserver-plugins.sh --lib-dir /path/to/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/ --install

    Done

If you prefer to install the GeoMesa Accumulo GeoServer plugin manually, unpack the contents of the
``geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz`` file in ``geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/dist/geoserver/``
in the binary distribution or ``geomesa-$VERSION/geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin/target/`` in the source distribution
into your GeoServer's ``lib`` directory (``$VERSION`` = |release|):

If you are using Tomcat:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/dist/geoserver/geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

If you are using GeoServer's built in Jetty web server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/dist/geoserver/geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

There are additional JARs for Accumulo, Zookeeper, Hadoop, and Thrift that will
be specific to your installation that you will also need to copy to GeoServer's
``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. For example, GeoMesa only requires Hadoop
|hadoop_version|, but if you are using Hadoop 2.5.0 you should use the JARs
that match the version of Hadoop you are running.

There is a script in the ``geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/bin`` directory
(``$GEOMESA_HOME/bin/install-hadoop-accumulo.sh``) which will install these
dependencies to a target directory using ``wget`` (requires an internet
connection).

.. note::

    You may have to edit the ``install-hadoop-accumulo.sh`` script to set the
    versions of Accumulo, Zookeeper, Hadoop, and Thrift you are running.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ $GEOMESA_HOME/bin/install-hadoop-accumulo.sh /path/to/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

.. _install_geomesa_process:

A note about GeoMesa Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Some GeoMesa-specific WPS processes such as ``geomesa:Density``, which is used
    in the generation of heat maps, also require ``geomesa-process-$VERSION.jar``.
    This JAR is included in the ``geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-dist/target/geomesa-accumulo_2.11-$VERSION/dist/geoserver`` directory of the binary
    distribution, or is built in the ``geomesa-process`` module of the source
    distribution.

.. _install_kafka_geoserver:

For Kafka
^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    These instructions are identical for Kafka 0.8.x, 0.9.x, and 0.10.x. The value of ``$KAFKAVERSION`` is
    "08" for Kafka 0.8.x, "09" for Kafka 0.9.x, or "10" for Kafka 0.10.x.

To install GeoMesa's GeoServer plugin we can use the script ``manage-geoserver-plugins.sh`` in ``bin`` directory
of the appropriate GeoMesa Kafka binary distribution (see :ref:`versions_and_downloads`).

.. note::

    If $GEOSERVER_HOME is set, then the ``--lib-dir`` parameter is not needed.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/manage-geoserver-plugins.sh --lib-dir /path/to/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/ --install

+------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------------+

The contents of the appropriate plugin archive should be unpacked in the GeoServer
``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. If you are using Tomcat:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-gs-plugin/dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

If you are using GeoServer's built in Jetty web server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-gs-plugin/dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

This will install the JARs for the Kafka GeoServer plugin and most of its dependencies.
However, you will also need additional JARs for Kafka and Zookeeper that will
be specific to your installation that you will also need to copy to GeoServer's
``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. For example,you should use the JARs that match the version of
Kafka you are running.

.. warning::

    GeoMesa |release| depends on Scala 2.11, so you should make sure you use the
    Kafka version built with Scala 2.11 as well (``kafka_2.11_*``) to avoid
    compatibility issues.

Copy these additional dependencies (or the equivalents for your Kafka installation) to
your GeoServer ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory.

Kafka 0.8

    * kafka-clients-0.8.2.1.jar
    * kafka_2.11-0.8.2.1.jar
    * metrics-core-2.2.0.jar
    * zkclient-0.3.jar
    * zookeeper-3.4.6.jar

Kafka 0.9

    * kafka-clients-0.9.0.1.jar
    * kafka_2.11-0.9.0.1.jar
    * metrics-core-2.2.0.jar
    * zkclient-0.7.jar
    * zookeeper-3.4.6.jar

Kafka 0.10

    * kafka-clients-0.10.0.1.jar
    * kafka-2.11-0.10.0.1.jar
    * metrics-core-2.2.0.jar
    * zkclient-0.8.jar
    * zookeeper-3.4.6.jar

There is a script in the ``geomesa-kafka-$KAFKAVERSION_2.11-$VERSION/bin`` directory
(``$GEOMESA_KAFKA_HOME/bin/install-kafka.sh``) which will install these
dependencies to a target directory using ``wget`` (requires an internet
connection).

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

.. _install_hbase_geoserver:

For HBase
^^^^^^^^^

The HBase GeoServer plugin is not bundled by default in the GeoMesa binary distribution
and should be built from source. Download the source distribution (see
:ref:`building_from_source`), go to the ``geomesa-hbase/geomesa-hbase-gs-plugin``
directory, and build the module using the ``hbase`` Maven profile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -Phbase

After building, extract ``target/geomesa-hbase-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz`` into GeoServer's
``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. Note that this plugin contains a shaded JAR with HBase 1.1.5
bundled. If you require a different version, modify the ``pom.xml`` and rebuild following
the instructions above.

This distribution does not include the Hadoop or Zookeeper JARs; the following JARs
should be copied from the ``lib`` directory of your HBase or Hadoop installations into
GeoServer's ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory:

 * hadoop-annotations-2.5.1.jar
 * hadoop-auth-2.5.1.jar
 * hadoop-common-2.5.1.jar
 * hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.5.1.jar
 * hadoop-yarn-api-2.5.1.jar
 * hadoop-yarn-common-2.5.1.jar
 * zookeeper-3.4.6.jar
 * commons-configuration-1.6.jar

(Note the versions may vary depending on your installation.)

The HBase data store requires the configuration file ``hbase-site.xml`` to be on the classpath. This can
be accomplished by placing the file in ``geoserver/WEB-INF/classes`` (you should make the directory if it
doesn't exist).

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

.. _install_bigtable_geoserver:

For Bigtable
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Bigtable GeoServer plugin is not bundled by default in the GeoMesa binary distribution
and should be built from source. Download the source distribution (see
:ref:`building_from_source`) and build the module using the ``bigtable`` Maven profile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -Pbigtable

After building, extract ``geomesa-hbase/geomesa-bigtable-gs-plugin/target/geomesa-bigtable-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz``
into GeoServer's ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. This distribution does not include HBase or Hadoop JARs; the following JARs
should be copied into GeoServer's ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory:

 * commons-configuration-1.6.jar
 * hadoop-annotations-2.5.2.jar
 * hadoop-auth-2.5.2.jar
 * hadoop-client-2.5.2.jar
 * hadoop-common-2.5.2.jar
 * hadoop-hdfs-2.5.2.jar
 * hbase-annotations-1.1.2.jar
 * hbase-client-1.2.3.jar
 * hbase-common-1.2.3.jar
 * hbase-hadoop2-compat-1.1.2.jar
 * hbase-hadoop-compat-1.1.2.jar
 * hbase-prefix-tree-1.1.2.jar
 * hbase-procedure-1.1.2.jar
 * hbase-protocol-1.2.3.jar
 * hbase-server-1.1.2.jar

(Note the versions may vary depending on your installation.)

The Bigtable data store requires the configuration file ``hbase-site.xml`` to be on the classpath. This can
be accomplished by placing the file in ``geoserver/WEB-INF/classes`` (you should make the directory if it
doesn't exist). For more information, see `Connecting to Cloud Bigtable
<https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/connecting-hbase>`__.

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

.. _install_cassandra_geoserver:

For Cassandra
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GeoMesa Cassandra distribution includes a GeoServer plugin for including
Cassandra data stores in GeoServer. The plugin files are in the
``dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-cassandra-gs-plugin_2.11-$VERSION-install.tar.gz`` archive within the
GeoMesa Cassandra distribution directory.
To install the plugins, extract the archive and copy the contents to the ``WEB-INF/lib``
directory of your GeoServer installation. You will also need to copy the JARs from the
``lib`` directory of your Cassandra installation into the GeoServer ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory.

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

Additional Configuration
------------------------

GeoMesa uses a site xml file to maintain system property configurations. This file can be found
at ``conf/geomesa-site.xml`` of either the GeoMesa Accumulo or GeoMesa Kafka distributions. The default settings
for GeoMesa are stored in ``conf/geomesa-site.xml.template``. Do not modify this file directly as it is never read,
instead copy the desired configurations into geomesa-site.xml.

By default command line parameters will take precedence over this configuration file. If you wish
a configuration item to always take precedence, even over command line parameters change the
``<final>`` tag to true.

By default, configuration properties with empty values will not be applied; you can change this
by marking a property as final.

Upgrading
---------

To upgrade between minor releases of GeoMesa, the versions of all GeoMesa components
**must** match. This means that the version of the ``geomesa-distributed-runtime``
JAR installed on Accumulo tablet servers **must** match the version of the
``geomesa-plugin`` JARs installed in the ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory of GeoServer.

We strive to maintain backwards compatibility for data ingested with older
releases of GeoMesa, and in general data ingested with older releases
may be read with newer ones (note that the reverse does not apply). For example,
data ingested into Accumulo with GeoMesa 1.2.2 may be read with 1.2.3.

It should be noted, however, that data ingested with older GeoMesa versions may
not take full advantage of indexing improvements in newer releases. If
it is not feasible to reingest old data, see :ref:`update_index_format_job`
for more information on updating its index format.




Security Concerns
-----------------

Apache Commons Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 3.2.1 and earlier of the Apache Commons Collections library have a CVSS 10.0 vulnerability.  Read more `here
<https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/security-reports.html>`__.

Note that Accumulo 1.6.5 is the first version of Accumulo which addresses this security concern.
Fixes for the GeoServer project will be available in versions 2.8.3+ and 2.9.0+.
