Prepackaged Converter Definitions
=================================

GeoMesa Tools distributions contain several prepackaged converters for common, publically
available data sources.

.. note::

    The examples in the sections below are often specific to the GeoMesa Accumulo distribution,
    but the general principle is the same for each distribution. Only the home variable and
    command-line tool name will differ depending on GeoMesa distribution.
