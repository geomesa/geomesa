Getting Started
===============

The :doc:`/tutorials/index` section demonstrate many of the capabilities of GeoMesa. In particular, see:

GeoMesa Accumulo
----------------

The GeoMesa Accumulo Quick Start tutorial is the fastest and easiest way to get started with GeoMesa.
It is a good stepping-stone on the path to the other tutorials that present increasingly involved examples
of how to use GeoMesa. It shows how to write custom Java code to ingest and query data in Accumulo with GeoMesa,
and visualize the changes being made in GeoServer.

See :doc:`/tutorials/geomesa-quickstart-accumulo`.

GeoMesa Kafka
-------------

The GeoMesa Kakfa Quick Start tutorial shows how to write custom Java code to produce and consume messages in
Apache Kafka using GeoMesa, query the data and replay the messages in a Kafka topic to achieve an earlier state,
and visualize the changes being made in Kafka with GeoServer.

See :doc:`/tutorials/geomesa-quickstart-kafka`.
