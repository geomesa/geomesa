# GeoMesa Plugin

### Building Instructions

If you wish to build this project separately, you can with mvn clean install

```geomesa/geomesa-geoserver-plugin/geomesa-accumulo-geoserver-plugin> mvn clean install```

This will produce a zip of jars in target/ which are intended to be as a plugin for Geoserver.  They should be deployed to
Geoserver's WEB-INF/lib directory.
